So basicly this a very simple were it will display a " Hello linux "with changing colors. I really don't know the point of this but again I'm just doing shit here. So to do this your gonna copy and paste the code in a bash script file ( e.g., 'colorful_hello.sh'), ( MAKE SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT EXECUTABLE!) and then run it with ./colorful_hello.shYou'll see the "Hello, Linux!" message changing colors every second.
